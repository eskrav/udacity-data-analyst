## Summary

My project focuses on the 2012 PISA dataset.  In my visualization, I show that various factors connected to individual and region-wide socio-economic well-being are predictive of international and regional math, reading, and science test scores.  

## Design

After collecting feedback, I made the graphic somewhat less free-form and interactive.  It became clear that simply setting up the scenario, including clues to guide the user in gaining their own insights, did not effectively get the intended point across.  In the end, I decided to focus on a relatively limited phenomenon (I had originally planned to add more unrelated measures that the user could dynamically plot, if they wanted), clearly spell out intended conclusions, present all critical plots instead of expecting the user to dynamically generate them, and provide a more clear guide to interpreting use of color.  I also changed the color schemes to something (hopefully) more easily interpretable (in terms of a consistent gradient from 'good' to 'bad').

## Feedback

The feedback I got was the following, summarized:

* Insights to be gained were completely opaque - the user was able to compare country performance, but did not get the link between socio-economic factors and test scores at all.
* Use of color was confusing and poorly explained - the user was unable to tell if a color signified something 'good,' something 'bad,' or nothing at all - or which patterns they were supposed to spot.
* Map moved around too much and was somewhat difficult to work with/zoom (this seems to be a flaw inherent to Tableau, however).
* It was unclear what, in fact, was being plotted.  To some degree, the plots alone seem insufficient to explain what the PISA is, but this could nevertheless be made clearer.

## Resources

The resources I used are the following:

* PISA 2012 [technical report](./PISA-2012-technical-report-final.pdf), and [results overview](./pisa-2012-results-overview.pdf), for interpreting results and comparing generated country test scores.
* [`intsvy`](https://www.jstatsoft.org/article/view/v081i07/0) R package for generating country-wide and regional test scores, as the PISA guides indicate individual student scores are not informative (https://nces.ed.gov/surveys/pisa/faq.asp#10).
* Info on calculating Gini coefficient (measure of wealth inequality): https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gini_coefficient
