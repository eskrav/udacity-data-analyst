* Write-up: PDF or Markdown file that includes links to your Tableau Public workbooks, published online, and a write-up with four sections. See HERE if you need help publishing your Tableau Public Workbook.
    - Summary: in no more than 4 sentences, briefly introduce your data visualization and add any context that can help readers understand it
    - Design: explain any design choices you made including changes to the visualization after collecting feedback
    - Feedback: include all feedback you received from others on your visualization from the first sketch to the final visualization
    - Resources: list any sources you consulted to create your visualization

## Step Five - Get Feedback

Share your visualization with *at least one other person* and document their feedback. There are many ways to get feedback, and more feedback is generally better! Here are some options.

* Share your visualization with others in person and have them think aloud as they read and explore the graphic so you can document what stands out to them and how they interpret the graphic.
* Share a link to your project in the Data Analyst Nanodegree Slack and ask others to share constructive criticisms. Be sure to offer advice to others who are seeking feedback too!

You might need to ask specific questions to prompt the reader. Here are some questions to help you. You can, of course, ask others.

* What do you notice in the visualization?
* What questions do you have about the data?
* What relationships do you notice?
* What do you think is the main takeaway from this visualization?
* Is there something you don’t understand in the graphic?

## Step Six - Document Feedback and Improve the Visualization

For each person that gives you feedback, add the person’s feedback to your write-up file in the Feedback section. As you improve and iterate on your visualization, update the visualization *AND* describe any changes in the Design section of the write-up.

You should save multiple versions of your data visualization after you make changes to it. Remember to save related files with similar numbers.

When should you save your files? You should save your files whenever you have a working version of your data visualization. If you get feedback and make changes, then create a new file and save the file as another version.

Your goal is to build evidence that you have shared your visualization, received feedback, and responded to that feedback. *You need to submit an initial version of your data visualization and the final version with the corresponding write-up.*
