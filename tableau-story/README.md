This project focused on the 2012 PISA dataset, and the relationship of educational rankings and scores with regional demographics. I organize and summarize the data using R, and then use interactive Tableau plots to show that various factors connected to individual and region-wide socio-economic well-being are predictive of international and regional math, reading, and science test scores.
