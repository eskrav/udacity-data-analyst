In this project, I set out to explore and analyze data from [Prosper loans](https://www.prosper.com/), a peer-to-peer lending organization.  My task was to clean and organize the data, note and explore any interesting trends, and present a final graphical summary of the most relevant trends I identified.  I ended up focusing on the degree to which various leasee demographics (such as income or credit rating) predicted the likeihood of loan default, as well as the degree to which Prosper loan categories and ratings accurately predicted the likelihood of default or of the lender profiting from the loan.
